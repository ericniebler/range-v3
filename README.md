range-v3
========

Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis of [a formal proposal](https://ericniebler.github.io/std/wg21/D4128.html) to add range support to the C++ standard library. That proposal evolved through a Technical Specification, and finally into [P0896R4 "The One Ranges Proposal"](https://wg21.link/p0896r4) which was merged into the C++20 working drafts in November 2018.

About:
------

Ranges are an extension of the Standard Template Library that makes its iterators and algorithms more powerful by making them _composable_. Unlike other range-like solutions which seek to do away with iterators, in range-v3 ranges are an abstration layer _on top_ of iterators.

Range-v3 is built on three pillars: Views, Actions, and Algorithms. The algorithms are the same as those with which you are already familiar in the STL, except that in range-v3 all the algorithms have overloads that take ranges in addition to the overloads that take iterators. Views are composable adaptations of ranges where the adaptation happens lazily as the view is iterated. and_v an action is an eager application of an algorithm to a container that mutates the container in-place and returns it for further processing.

Views and actions use the pipe syntax (e.g., `rng | adapt1 | adapt2 | ...`) so your code is terse and readable from left to right.

Supported Compilers
-------------------

The code is known to work on the following compilers:

- clang 3.6.2 (or later)
- GCC 5.0.2 (or later) (C++14 "extended constexpr" support is poor before 6.1.)
- Clang/LLVM 6 (or later) on Windows (older versions may work - we haven't tested.)
- Visual Studio 2019 Preview 4 (or later) on Windows, with some caveats due to range-v3's strict conformance requirements:
  - range-v3 needs `/std:c++17 /permissive-`
  - range-v3 needs a fully conforming preprocessor, so `/experimental:preprocessor` is necessary. Note that the conforming preprocessor diagnoses `C5105` "macro expansion producing 'defined' has undefined behavior" in some of the Windows SDK headers, so you'll probably want to suppress that warning with `/wd5105`.

[ Note: We've "retired" support for Clang/C2 with the VS2015 toolset (i.e., the `v140_clang_c2` toolset) which Microsoft no longer supports for C++ use. We no longer have CI runs, but haven't gone out of our way to break anything, so it will likely continue to work. ]

**Development Status:** This code is fairly stable, well-tested, and suitable for casual use, although currently lacking documentation. _In general_, no promise is made about support or long-term stability. This code *will* evolve without regard to backwards compatibility.

A notable exception is anything found within the `ranges::cpp20` namespace. Those components will change rarely or (preferably) never at all.

* **0.4.0** Oct 18, 2018
  - Minor interface-breaking changes:
    * `single_view` returns by `const &` (see [#817](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/817)).
    * `reverse_view` of a non-Sized, non-Bounded RandomAccess range (eg., a null-terminated string) no longer satisfies SizedRange.
    * The `generate` and `generate_n` views now return the generated values by xvalue reference (`T &&`) to the value cached within the view (see [#905](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/905)).
    * Views no longer prefer returning constant iterators when they can; some views have different constant and mutable iterators.
  - Enhancements:
    * Views can successfully adapt other views that have different constant and mutable iterators.
    * The `single` and `empty` views are much closer to the versions as specified in [P0896](http://wg21.link/P0896).

    * "Calling back() on strided range does not return the correct last value in range" [#901](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/901).
    * "generate(foo) | take(n) calls foo n+1 times" [#819](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/819).
    * "generate seems broken with move-only return types" [#905](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/905).

  - Fix `const`-correctness problem in `views::chunk` (see [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49210190)).
  - Replace uses of `ranges::result_of` with `ranges::invoke_result`.
  - Fix potential buffer overrun of `views::drop` over RandomAccessRanges.
  - Lots of `views::cartesian_product` fixes (see [ericniebler/stl2\#820](https://github.com/ericniebler/stl2/issues/820), [ericniebler/stl2\#823](https://github.com/ericniebler/stl2/issues/823)).

  - Reworked `any_view`, the type-erased view wrapper.
  - `equal` algorithm is `constexpr` in C++14.
  - `stride_view` no longer needs an `atomic` data member.

  - `action::reverse`
* **0.2.0** March 13, 2017
  Bring many interfaces into sync with the Ranges TS.
  - Many interfaces are simply renamed. The following table shows the old names
    and the new. (All names are in the `ranges::v3` namespace.)

    | Old Name                      | New Name                  |
    |-------------------------------|---------------------------|
    | `indirect_swap`               | `iter_swap`               |
    | `indirect_move`               | `iter_move`               |
    | `iterator_value_t`            | `value_type_t`            |
    | `iterator_reference_t`        | `reference_t`             |
    | `iterator_difference_t`       | `difference_type_t`       |
    | `iterator_size_t`             | `size_type_t`             |
    | `iterator_rvalue_reference_t` | `rvalue_reference_t`      |
    | `iterator_common_reference_t` | `iter_common_reference_t` |
    | `range_value_t`               | `range_value_type_t`      |
    | `range_difference_t`          | `range_difference_type_t` |
    | `range_size_t`                | `range_size_type_t`       |
    | `range_iterator_t`            | `iterator_t`              |
    | `range_sentinel_t`            | `sentinel_t`              |
  - `common_iterator` now requires that its two types (`Iterator` and `Sentinel`)
    are different. Use `common_iterator_t<I, S>` to get the old behavior (i.e., if the two types are the same, it is an alias for `I`; otherwise, it is
    `common_iterator<I, S>`).
  - The following iterator adaptors now work with iterators that return proxies
    from their postfix increment operator (i.e., `operator++(int)`):
    * `common_iterator`
    * `counted_iterator`
  - The following customization points are now implemented per the Ranges TS
    spec and will no longer find the associated unconstrained overload in
    namespace `std::`:
    * `ranges::begin`
    * `ranges::end`
    * `ranges::size`
    * `ranges::swap`
    * `ranges::iter_swap`

    (In practice, this has very little effect but it may effect overloading in
    rare situations.)
  - `ranges::is_swappable` now only takes one template parameter. The new
    `ranges::is_swappable_with<T, U>` tests whether `T` and `U` are swappable.
    `ranges::is_swappable<T>` is equivalent to `ranges::is_swappable_with<T &, T &>`.
  - The following object concepts have changed to conform with the Ranges TS
    specification, and approved changes (see [P0547](http://wg21.link/p0547)):
    * `Destructible`
    * `Constructible`
    * `DefaultConstructible`
    * `MoveConstructible`
    * `MoveConstructible`
    * `Movable`
    * `Assignable`
  - The `View` concept is no longer satisfied by reference types.
  - The syntax for defining a concept has changed slightly. See [iterator/concepts.hpp](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/blob/master/include/range/v3/iterator/concepts.hpp) for examples.
* **0.1.1**
  Small tweak to `Writable` concept to fix #537.
* **0.1.0**
  March 8, 2017, Begin semantic versioning
